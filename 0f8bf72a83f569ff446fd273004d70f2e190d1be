      "message": "Yes, you are quite right Tony. I will modify the change to include these references, because I was not aware of them until I start working on CNF Cert Suite v3.0.1. Now, I have more knowledge about this, so I guess it will be easier in that way.\nMoreover, I will also try to test this with the change Fred has included in test-runner, that\u0027s why I left this CR in this status, because I wanted to do that check beforehand, but Fred has just finished it, so it can be tested now.",
