      "message": "I have some concerns with the current status of chart-verifier and also the scope of this change. My impression is that the current role is executing, by default, a specific example that is hardcoded in the role. Isn\u0027t it better to move all this to a sample, like tnf_test_example, and run it as a hook? Then, have the general chart-verifier role logic that applies for all the cases that can be tested, but having the specific example separated in hooks. What do you think?",

      "message": "The example in the defaults will point to the sandbox. The problem here is that we need to create projects for each chart before testing and pushing to the openshift repo also requires that the chart has a real different version (you cannot certify a chart already certified), so adding this to a CI won\u0027t be easy. Do not wanna pollute the official charts repository with our test jobs.\n\nThe part of adding it as a sample/hook can be addressed once we know how to dynamically manage projects in the connect site.",
