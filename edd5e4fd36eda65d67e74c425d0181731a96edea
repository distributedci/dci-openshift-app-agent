      "message": "I have some concerns with the current status of chart-verifier and also the scope of this change. My impression is that the current role is executing, by default, a specific example that is hardcoded in the role. Isn\u0027t it better to move all this to a sample, like tnf_test_example, and run it as a hook? Then, have the general chart-verifier role logic that applies for all the cases that can be tested, but having the specific example separated in hooks. What do you think?",
