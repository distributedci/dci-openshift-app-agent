Please consider that for operators that have it CSV created on all namespaces, you will have multiple entries in the output.\n\nhttps://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-openshift-agent/blob/2079b55a2814ac415bfd7638e0e91bc642e037dc/plays/scripts/get-ocp-logs#L95C1-L95C162\n\nYou may need to update the readme with this new output. \n\nRegards",
