      "message": "Maybe, I would include a variable referencing the version to be used of the preflight container. This is, because, if the latest version of the code changes, it may have an impact in the outcomes you obtain and the task may fail. By including the version as variable, you can include the latest version tested and then, for new releases, test using the latest version and then change the default version to newer versions when tested and validated, also changing your tasks with the corresponding updates. This is done for the CNF Cert Suite, in fact.",

In any case, if new images need to be checked, the variable can be redefined in the corresponding pipeline, leaving this definition as default value.\nSecondly, I would document the meaning of the new variables, also preflight_artifacts, in the d-o-a-a README, to have it as reference.",
