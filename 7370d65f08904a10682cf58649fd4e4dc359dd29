      "message": "I would prefer to leave it because, at least from my point of view, it is quicker to check the results by looking at execution.log through the DCI GUI. If using the tar.gz file, you need to download it.\n\nThis change intends to solve the problem in which execution.log is not uploaded to DCI, which is happening for some partners. In that case, they should have the tar.gz file to see the results of the execution.",

      "message": "IMO, the change does not address the issue, but provides a more reliable way to store a copy of the log, in a tarball, in DCI. \n\nSeems like part of the problem is the size of the log file. And a big file is hard to see in the browser, when there\u0027s one. I think is reasonable to not upload the log file and just upload the tarball. Thoughts?\n\n---\n\nRegarding the failure, in the test-runner a non-zero was detected at the end of the job causing that FAILURE message. Since any job tested with check with a KUBECONFIG won\u0027t go through the dci-queue then I can\u0027t see any logs in there. If you ran it in a tmux session, maybe you could see what happened.",
