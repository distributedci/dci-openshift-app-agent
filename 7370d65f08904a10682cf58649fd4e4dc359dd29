      "message": "I would prefer to leave it because, at least from my point of view, it is quicker to check the results by looking at execution.log through the DCI GUI. If using the tar.gz file, you need to download it.\n\nThis change intends to solve the problem in which execution.log is not uploaded to DCI, which is happening for some partners. In that case, they should have the tar.gz file to see the results of the execution.",
