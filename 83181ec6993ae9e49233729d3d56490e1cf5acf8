      "message": "I agree, but the thing is, there are partners that are not using the latest stable tnf version, so we have to support old settings and configs until confirming all the partners are using the latest stable versions. And preflight execution is currently in the unstable version. So we\u0027ll have to wait some time before completely remove the role. But yes, I agree, and the plan is to do it.",
