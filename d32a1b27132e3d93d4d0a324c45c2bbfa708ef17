      "message": "Tania, thanks for considering our comments. Here I have some concerns, I suspect if we delete the pods they will be recreated immediately because they are controlled by a Deployment or a StatefulSet, that\u0027s why I believe we need to scale down or delete these resources instead of deleting the pod. Of course, first we can try your approach and see if that works.",
