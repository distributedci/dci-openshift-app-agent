      "message": "Tania, thanks for considering our comments. Here I have some concerns, I suspect if we delete the pods they will be recreated immediately because they are controlled by a Deployment or a StatefulSet, that\u0027s why I believe we need to scale down or delete these resources instead of deleting the pod. Of course, first we can try your approach and see if that works.",

      "message": "I think if you just set `wait: true` (or whatever the param is) on deleting deployments/statefulsets and _then_ delete the namespace you should be good to go because that will a) delete all pods for all statefulsets b) delete all pods from all deployments c) delete the namespace which will delete any leftover pods, just make sure to move the delete_options to the 2 calls above",
