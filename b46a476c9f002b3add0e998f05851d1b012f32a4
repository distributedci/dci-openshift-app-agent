Here we can see that the pods are able to be deployed fine with istio container: https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/49276e7b-4953-4781-8d11-86d27fa51a40/jobStates?sort\u003ddate\u0026task\u003db3938535-0802-473c-89a0-22ec08a15c14\n\nThe failure is because tnf detected some tests that should pass are now failing, but since this change is just to include the functionality of istio workloads in tnf_test_example, it\u0027s enough to consider this change for being merged.\n\nI\u0027ll address the issue of tnf tests that are now failing when re-testing platform-alteration-service-mesh test in https://github.com/dci-labs/dallas-pipelines/pull/1020\n\n@Manuel adding you as reviewer since you already checked the pipelines PR",
