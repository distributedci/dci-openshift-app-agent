      "message": "The change is working fine in tnf-test-cnf pipeline, where we are creating the preflight_operators_to_certify from scratch.\n\nHowever, I am having difficulties to run example-cnf because of the usual failures we have. What I am going to do is to run a fresh OCP 4.9 vanilla job on cluster5 and then run example-cnf on top on it, to check if it works. But I guess it should work, because we are not creating anything new in preflight_operators_to_certify for that case. Anyway, I will wait for that result to confirm everything.",

I will define it in the tnf-test-cnf pipeline, which is the case where we create preflight_operators_to_certify from scratch, and using the same id you are using for example-cnf and preflight pipelines.\nWhat do you think?",
