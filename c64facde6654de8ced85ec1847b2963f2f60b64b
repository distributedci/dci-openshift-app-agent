This way, it\u0027s easy to debug frequent timeout errors when one of the numerous pods doesn\u0027t start.\n\nThe logs are retrieved three times, with 50 seconds pause in-between. The pause duration is chosen to comply with the global Preflight timeout of 180 seconds.\n\nLog files are in preflight_operator_async_*, here is an example: https://www.distributed-ci.io/files/78786d1a-aa78-40c0-9d94-96d2d2a2d787",
