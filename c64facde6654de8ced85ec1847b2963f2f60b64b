      "message": "Hello everyone, the change is ready for review. \n\nThe idea is to retrieve cluster state _during_ Preflight tests execution. This way, it\u0027s easy to debug frequent timeout errors when one of the numerous pods doesn\u0027t start.\n\nThe logs are retrieved three times, with 50 seconds pause in-between. The pause duration is chosen to comply with the global Preflight timeout of 180 seconds.\n\nLog files are in preflight_operator_async_*, here is an example: https://www.distributed-ci.io/files/78786d1a-aa78-40c0-9d94-96d2d2a2d787",

      "message": "Hello Tatiana, \n\nAgree with Pierre about having a single log file per operator or maybe zip the files for each operator. Can we have something to enable it like enable_debug\u003dtrue/false?\n\nI was trying \"ocp cluster-info dump\" https://access.redhat.com/articles/4676051 it collects the information that you need but csv data :(\n\nAlso Tony found this script: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5496071 that looks very complete. We may add this as an utility script for the agent or the hook that can be executed on demand (asynchronous or synchronous). \n\nThanks\n ",
