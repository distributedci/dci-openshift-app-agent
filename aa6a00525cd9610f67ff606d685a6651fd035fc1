The app-agent already has a dependency on the community kubernetes collection: https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-openshift-app-agent/blob/master/dci-openshift-app-agent.spec#L23\n\nThe RPM version is 1.1.1. Then we don\u0027t need those requirements.yml, IMO we need to document them better in the README, as the only ones installed afaik are the ones coming in tests/requirements.yml the rest are ignored.",
