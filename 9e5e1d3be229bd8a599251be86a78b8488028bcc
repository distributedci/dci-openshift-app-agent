      "message": "Hi Tony, thanks for the change, but I think this may not avoid the real problem is happening in dallas, as I commented in CILAB-755: the issue appeared because of concurrency issues. If there are two daily pipelines using preflight at the same time, it may happen that one deletes the image and the other one tries to delete it and it cannot be done because it doesn\u0027t exist.\nIt\u0027s also happening on tnf, in fact.\nAs a solution, I was thinking in two different options: 1) remove the image only if it\u0027s a different one than the default one to be tested, or 2) include ignore_errors\nWhat do you think?",

      "message": "That\u0027s a great point, parallel jobs. But in preflight I\u0027m afraid is not the case. Preflight images are only created through openshift-preflight PRs (Thanks to Tania that helped me to understand this)\n\nNow, back to parallel jobs. Is possible to have parallel jobs in preflight with multiple PRs, but each image is created with a PR tag, making them unique. If the same PR is updated while a job is running it will be killed and replaced avoiding the parallel job scenario.\n\nCorrect me if I\u0027m wrong, but sounds like TNF issues are simlar, but not the same as to those reported in CILAB-755",
