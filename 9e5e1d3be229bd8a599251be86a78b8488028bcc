      "message": "Hi Tony, thanks for the change, but I think this may not avoid the real problem is happening in dallas, as I commented in CILAB-755: the issue appeared because of concurrency issues. If there are two daily pipelines using preflight at the same time, it may happen that one deletes the image and the other one tries to delete it and it cannot be done because it doesn\u0027t exist.\nIt\u0027s also happening on tnf, in fact.\nAs a solution, I was thinking in two different options: 1) remove the image only if it\u0027s a different one than the default one to be tested, or 2) include ignore_errors\nWhat do you think?",
