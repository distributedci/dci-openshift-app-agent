I think we don\u0027t really need to link f5-bigip-config change to this one, because we usually run BigIP, SPK, etc. with the VCP pipeline rather than using d-o-a-a. But do you think we can try to run BigIP, etc. with d-o-a-a? What\u0027s your opinion? It would be really interesting to avoid redeploying the full cluster each time 😊, but I\u0027m not sure it is possible",
