      "message": "Hi Beto, just one observation from my side. I think we don\u0027t really need to link f5-bigip-config change to this one, because we usually run BigIP, SPK, etc. with the VCP pipeline rather than using d-o-a-a. But do you think we can try to run BigIP, etc. with d-o-a-a? What\u0027s your opinion? It would be really interesting to avoid redeploying the full cluster each time 😊, but I\u0027m not sure it is possible",

I was trying to test the changes in the doa hooks and also the changes in the app agent in one shot running \"check 23841 ocp-4.7-vcp fake-cnf\" on the jumphost.\n\nThat will pull the 3 changes, deploy vpc with the f5/spk changes and also check the dooa stuff. \n\nThanks",
