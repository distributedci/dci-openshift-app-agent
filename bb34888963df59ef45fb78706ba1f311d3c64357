Do we need to update the credentials we\u0027re using for fixing that?",

      "message": "I\u0027d prefer to wait for Tatiana\u0027s opinion on this, because for example, in CNF Cert, we always update the tag when there\u0027s a new release, instead of using \"latest\", just to have the control in case we need to add some changes on DCI for newer releases. I think we would need the same for Preflight and that\u0027s why we should keep doing this.",

      "message": "That\u0027s fair, the version really has more meaning that stable, but I think we find a way to validate that and automate that change instead of doing this manually.\n\nMy thoughts on this compared to CNF is that preflight does not use latest but stable, stable is a tag added manually after some time to their releases, so it\u0027s not immediately latest.\n\nAlso, we are testing \"stable\" in the daily jobs, e.g.\n\nhttps://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/f08b5ced-7cfa-4da1-af47-00205b8aa439/jobStates?sort\u003ddate\u0026task\u003db51f6288-1da1-4769-9780-b0e450ca7186\n\n    \"preflight_image\": \"quay.io/opdev/preflight:stable\"\n\nBut let\u0027s get it going and find a way to automate this.",
