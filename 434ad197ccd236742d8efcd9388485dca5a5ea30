      "message": "This one looks fine. I\u0027d like to include a couple of things:\n-Can we redefine the docs (README) to redirect to d-o-a common-role to see the info related to the three variables X_X_to_components we are using? (if the approach commented in comments is finally followed)\n-Can we do a quick test on dci-openshift-app-agent over an already running cluster to verify this works? (we\u0027ll need to locate the common-role in /var/lib/dci, I guess, for this test)",

      "message": "Ramon, sure I\u0027ll include a note in the README to point to the new role README in the common-roles.\nAlso yes, I can run a test in a running cluster too, the new role once merged and packed in the RPM will go to /usr/share/dci/roles/ in the ansible controller node, but I think we can validate results in a running cluster without merging, as we depend on 25101, and it seems it\u0027s pulling the role from common-roles in that PR. I can see the components I passed in the d-o-a-a job:  https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/6326032e-7f9b-4d81-9c43-c9239f44ccf7/jobStates",
