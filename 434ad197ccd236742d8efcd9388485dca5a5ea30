I\u0027d like to include a couple of things:\n-Can we redefine the docs (README) to redirect to d-o-a common-role to see the info related to the three variables X_X_to_components we are using? (if the approach commented in comments is finally followed)\n-Can we do a quick test on dci-openshift-app-agent over an already running cluster to verify this works? (we\u0027ll need to locate the common-role in /var/lib/dci, I guess, for this test)",
