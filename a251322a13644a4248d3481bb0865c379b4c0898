Sorry for the unclear change description, I updated the readme and commit message.\n\nif-else \"connected-disconnected env\" is not really correct here, because we could have private registries even when working in connected environments.  \n\nConcerning the name change, from provisionhost_registry_creds to all_registries_creds, it\u0027s done to reflect the fact that pull-secret.txt file contains credentials for many registries, not only for one private registry in the disconnected environment.",
