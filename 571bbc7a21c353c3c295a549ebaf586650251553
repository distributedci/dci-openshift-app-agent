      "message": "Hi Ramon, thank you for the review. That\u0027s an urgent change that we need before 14 pm for the partner presentation. \n\nAs mentioned in the readme, that\u0027s for standalone container certification, when the operator is not yet ready. \n\n\u003e \"Also, do you expect to test this on libvirt to confirm it works in connected environments\"\n\nNo, here I do not change the logic, I expose the possibility to use it. The logic for container certification was already tested on libvirt. My tests here are to ensure that I set all variables properly.",
