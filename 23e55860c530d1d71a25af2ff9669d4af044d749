Are those changes part of TNF 4.2.3 and above? ",

      "message": "Hi Manuel. Yes, these two changes also belong to this transition towards the new version.\n\n- The debug daemonset is now launched in a different namespace, not in the default namespace, so I\u0027ve included some conditions regarding tnf v4.2.x\n- For the preflight, as in tnf v4.2.3/4 preflight doesn\u0027t belong to common label anymore, we have to explicitly check, in that case, if preflight label is used when using these tnf versions, this code is also present in this patch.",
