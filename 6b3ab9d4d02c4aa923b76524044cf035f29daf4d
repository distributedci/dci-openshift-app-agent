      "message": "I think the change is reasonable. I have another idea, let me know what you thing.\n\nSince we are deleting empty files when an error is produced, then we could also apply the same to successful executions that are also empty. e.g\n\nReplace: \n\n```\n|| rm -f {{ get_logs_folder }}/{{ get_logs_ns }}_status.log\n```\n\nWith:\n```\n; [ -s {{ get_logs_folder }}/{{ get_logs_ns }}_status.log ] \u0026\u0026 rm -f {{ get_logs_folder }}/{{ get_logs_ns }}_status.log\n```\n\nIf this gets too complex, another option is to delete the empty logs prior submission, thoughts?",

I also think we can delete the files in the same task, since it\u0027s a shell, I\u0027ll just separate lines to make it easier to read. \nI\u0027m using || rm -f {{ get_logs_folder }}/{{ get_logs_ns }}_status.log because we want to delete the files only if they are empty, I think \u0026\u0026 will delete them if their size is greater than zero.",
