I\u0027m afraid that, by following your suggestions, I will duplicate what Beto is doing on https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/dci-openshift-app-agent/+/24117. I\u0027ll talk to him to check if I can include some of his changes in my CR (e.g. the creation of a temp directory, the usage of teardown plays, etc.) to unblock this CR, or if I should wait for him to finish and then, when merging his CR, I can do a rebase and then reuse the tmp directory and all that stuff. For the moment, I\u0027ll put a -1 here.",
