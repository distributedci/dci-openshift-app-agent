      "message": "Hi guys, thanks for your comments. I\u0027m afraid that, by following your suggestions, I will duplicate what Beto is doing on https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/dci-openshift-app-agent/+/24117. I\u0027ll talk to him to check if I can include some of his changes in my CR (e.g. the creation of a temp directory, the usage of teardown plays, etc.) to unblock this CR, or if I should wait for him to finish and then, when merging his CR, I can do a rebase and then reuse the tmp directory and all that stuff. For the moment, I\u0027ll put a -1 here.",

      "message": "I think while it may be some similarities the two changes can be independent from each other. My suggestion is to not use a directory but a temp file.\n\nBeto\u0027s temp dir purpose is different, is meant for clients when not already installed and it\u0027s deleted in the same play.\n\nThe teardown may sound like the best place to have it, in case those creds are required later, but at the moment they are really not needed. So you could delete them right at the end of the pre-run.\n\nMy 2¢",
