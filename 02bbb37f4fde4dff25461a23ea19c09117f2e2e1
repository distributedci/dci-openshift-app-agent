But I\u0027m not familiar with aptible, not sure what are the differences between those two images if there is none, then I\u0027d say let\u0027s go with it, otherwise I\u0027ll try to find a mirror from the original.\n\nI found this one from nginxinc: mirror.gcr.io/nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged",

      "message": "Well, the job ran fine for fake-cnf case, so I would say it is working fine. For the image you proposed, I cannot copy it with skopeo:\n\n```\n[dciteam@jumphost dci-openshift-agent]$ skopeo copy --authfile /opt/cache/pull-secret.txt --remove-signatures mirror.gcr.io/nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged docker://registry.dfwt5g.lab:4443/nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged\nFATA[0000] Invalid source name mirror.gcr.io/nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged: Invalid image name \"mirror.gcr.io/nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged\", expected colon-separated transport:reference\n```\n\nI think that image is also present in docker.io, but if using that reference, we are again in the same problem related to the pull rate. So, is it fine to leave the aptible image for this simple case? Or may we move to other one? (e.g. any from redhat registry like https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/nginx-120/6156abfac739c0a4123a86fd)",
