I think even if job_info is undefined it will still try and see if job_info.job is undefined, etc..  which I think will throw an error.\n\nwhen:\n - job_info is undefined\n - job_info.job is undefined\n - job_info.job.id is undefined\n\nI believe it will stop checkinhg at the first one that is undefined which I believe is what we want.\n\nOr am I missing something?",
