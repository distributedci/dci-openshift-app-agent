      "message": "That\u0027s sort of urgent fix - we need it to be merged before Preflight team would merge #588, in order not to break our CI tests in Preflight repository.\n\nThis PR tries to address two issues seen in this job: https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/960ad924-8404-4d89-b45b-81a23be4d505/jobStates#2590f59b-c27b-4bb7-8353-537d8c60e275:file87\n- Podman auth was changed for check operator tests in Preflight PR #588.\n- Job should fail if result-junit.xml file wasn\u0027t generated - that usually means major disaster during preflight run.\n\nBoth issues are fixed:\n- Here we see that auth is back to be fine: https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/7a30fdcd-4dff-4412-a1fc-cb31fd8d7bd7/jobStates#85482d64-cf62-4941-8781-9b053089ad79:file87\n- Here we don\u0027t have auth fix, and we see that check of junit file presence works fine: https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/3672e008-c3f5-479f-975a-545e1d94c070/jobStates#5e76cd61-5c6e-414b-a550-7951a1442873:file92",
