      "message": "Thanks for catching this, Tony. Definitely, I\u0027ll move to your approach, because I\u0027ve seen that the ternary is not working as expected when any variable is undefined, because the ternary evaluates all the variables included, even though they are supposed to be undefined. So, I\u0027ll use one task to fail in case any of them is undefined, as you proposed, and the other one, I\u0027ll put the dci tag on it, instead of setting conditions. In theory, with the dci tag, we should ensure that job_info.job.id is provided. Is it fine with that approach?",
