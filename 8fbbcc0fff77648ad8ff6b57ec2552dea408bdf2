      "message": "Hi Charles, it seems like by default `skopeo inspect` expects to get credentials. What\u0027s why your fix is failing for open-access internal registry of our partner: https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/e46ab024-b511-4dc8-b8aa-afebeefca728/jobStates#1dc26b41-dafb-4249-a903-6eea5c6731ec:file22\n\nIt is required to manage both open-access and creds-access situations here, to have it working for all the partners. Currently, you only targetting the access-with-credentials situation.\n\nThe way to fix it would be to check if partner_creds is present, and if yes, to use --authfile. And if not, to use `--no-creds`.",
