      "message": "Thanks for your response guys. But, in fact, the purpose of using `tnf_config|default([])` in the loop clause is to avoid the cases of tnf_config being empty or undefined. In that case, tnf_config will not be iterated and it will not enter in the task, so consequently item.namespace will not be checked in that case. \n\nI tested it yesterday locally and it worked for these cases. I have created a Gist to reflect this, in case you want to check it: https://gist.github.com/ramperher/877b784e2652e4e6fc6fedb60937b142\n\nSo, I would say I would keep the task as it is right now. However, I have also added the condition of `item.namespace is defined` and `item.namespace|length` in the when clause, just in case a tnf_config variable is provided without a namespace. You will see it in the next patchset.\n\nTell me what you think about that, just to be sure.",

I will modify the code to do that, in the same way that I\u0027ve done in dump_ocp_logs.yml, for example.\n\nAnd, in case you execute a pipeline and you forget to set tnf_config to the correct values, this default value will be used and nothing will fail, but the CNF Cert Suite, when trying to execute, it will not do anything because no targetpodlabels are defined, so the execution will finish without tnf tests.",

You can check it in the Gist I referenced in dump_ocp_logs comments: https://gist.github.com/ramperher/877b784e2652e4e6fc6fedb60937b142, if you check the second block, you will see the task that uses a variable that does not exist is not executed because, then, it uses an empty list and it is not iterated.\nSo, in that case, if you find it fine, I would keep the task as it is right now, to follow the same approach in all cases.\n\nRegarding your question about dci_openshift_app_ns, if no tnf_config entry is provided, then the task will not be executed. We don\u0027t need to create dci_openshift_app_ns namespace in a separate task here because it is already done in the plays: https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-openshift-app-agent/blob/master/plays/install.yml#L3-L17, as commented above.\n\nMaybe, what I can do here (and in the rest of the tasks included here in install hook) is to include some checkings for the variables defined on each item of tnf_config, because it\u0027s true it does not make much sense to directly use item.namespace and set a default value in case it does not exist. Maybe it\u0027s better, e.g., to check if namespace exists and if the string has length \u003e 0, and if not, the task will not be called. I will do this for the next patchset.",
