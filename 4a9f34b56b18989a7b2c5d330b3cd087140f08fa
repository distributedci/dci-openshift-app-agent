      "message": "Hello everyone, the change is ready for review. Here are the tests:\n\n1/ preflight-green: https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/6749d6e8-e2b0-40a1-b1df-ed26706759e2/jobStates\n\nEverything is 100% ok.\n\n2/ operator-sdk: https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/9285cebe-3eb4-482c-a3da-3dce0900a34a/files\n\nThe job is green, but the tests are red, as you can see in the scorecard_* files. They are red because the scorecard-testing pod is trying to pull busybox:1.33.0 by tag.\n\nThis issue could be resolved in two ways: by contributing to Operator-SDK or by replacing ImageContentSourcePolicy with ImageTagMirrorSet and ImageDigestMirrorSet in DOAA. \n\nBoth solutions require external dependencies. That\u0027s why I would prefer to merge the skeleton right now and then work precisely on the issue.",

      "message": "Hi Tania, thanks for all the effort here, I have some questions and requests\n\nCould you help me to understand better what role is playing operator-sdk in the certification?\nIs the operator-sdk an alternative to certify operators as preflight? or is it only a subset for the certification?\n\nI\u0027m struggling to understand what the benefit operator-sdk is giving us on its own vs preflight.\n\nFor the role there are some changes that I\u0027d like to see\n\n- Variable names - Add a prefix to the role variables as we have been doing with other roles\nThis helps us to have better control over them and avoid clashing with other variables in other roles or plays.  So far we have been using the initials of the role\u0027s name, e.g. `os_` would be for operator-sdk role\n- Avoid using play variables, instead define a role variable to handle it, e.g. dci_disconnected -\u003e os_disconnected\n- Documentation should include dependencies, explanation of variables, its defaults and a few examples.\n- Cleanup after your role, not only directories but k8s resources need to be removed, e.g. ICSP\n\nAll of the above is to make the role as independent as possible.\n\nThanks!",
