      "message": "Thank you guys! As I explained in the daily, the change is working fine. In BOS2 job, the default value of tnf_feedback is used, and we can see it\u0027s not breaking anything. In Dallas jobs, we provide feedback for one of the tests that is always failing in our case (affiliated-certification-container-is-certified-digest), and the feedback is automatically appended to the HTML report, thanks to the feedback.js file. I\u0027ll merge it if you don\u0027t mind, so that we can test it with partners.",
