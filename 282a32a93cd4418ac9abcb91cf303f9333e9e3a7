      "message": "Here is the current state of the tests.\n\n1/ Check container mostly works. To verify:\n- I currently run Preflight binary without sudo. It\u0027s not recommended by Preflight but helps to avoid follow-up problems with logs upload. I\u0027m running additional tests to ensure that everything\u0027s fine.\n- ansible_user is not defined when d-o-a-a is running in the isolated way (with kubeconfig) on the top of the already installed cluster.\n- Submission to Pyxis was supposed to start working today. It didn\u0027t, will work on it later.\n\n2/ Check operator doesn\u0027t work - we should have 2/4 for testpmd but continue to have 1/4. Running tests on other operators.",
