      "message": "Not at all :) the tnf-execution.log will be generated but we will not copy it to the logs folder to submit it to DCI, because it\u0027s mainly the same file than dci-tnf-execution.log but without the bash script traces, so as our script is more complete, we\u0027ll not upload new tnf-execution.log file, but renaming ours to dci-tnf-execution.log file so that people knows that this file is related to the same than tnf one, but with more context info (so that it has the \"dci-\" header)",
