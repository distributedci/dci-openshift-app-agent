      "message": "The execution is working fine with the last changes. In theory, don\u0027t pay attention at all to the last job tested (tnf-test-cnf pipeline), where no CNF Cert Suite tests were executed, probably because of the inconsistent state in which cluster4 is currently. I will try to test it again in cluster5/6 to confirm it\u0027s not a problem.",

Do not pay attention to the results of the certification, it\u0027s probably because I ran the job while some MCP checks were being done in the OCP cluster, so that it may have become unstable for a while, making some tnf tests to fail, but they must pass in a normal execution.",

      "message": "The concern I have is that pullsecret_tmp_file does not contain local registry creds, does it?\n\nMy understanding is, *if* we\u0027re disconnected we need a local registry, the creds for the local registry is in partner_creds. Therefore, partner_creds is *required* when in a disconnected mode.\n\n- partner_creds in a connected mode is truly optional, when defined it contains just private registry creds (partners)\n- partner_creds in a disconnected mode is *not* optional, but it must have at least local registry creds and optionally have private registry creds (partners)\n\nPlease correct me if I\u0027m wrong here.\n\ncc: Tatiana",
