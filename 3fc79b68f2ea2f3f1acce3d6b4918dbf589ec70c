Here I retrieve more logs in the following flow:\n\n1/ Preflight updates ICSP 2/ Task implemented by Beto - wait for MC updates to be applied on the nodes. Sometimes this task fails. Usually, in such a situation one of the nodes is in the NotReady state. 3/ Current CR: retrieve detailed logs about each node, its configs, and events.\n\nThe retrieved information is dumped into cnf-example_mcp_logs.log file:\nhttps://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/1e949271-116a-4046-9e12-eaedde8b5f77/files ",
