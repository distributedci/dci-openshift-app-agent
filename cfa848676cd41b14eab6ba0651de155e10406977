      "message": "Hi Nacho, thanks for the change, I understand this will allow anyone in a hook to inject outputs to be passed to the next job through a set of pipelines. I wonder if you have an example of the use case for this requirement, and wondering if there is any other alternative to it.\n\nThe reason I\u0027m asking is because adding an output implies requiring an input in a following pipeline. But, in this case the input will be only useful for a pipeline that makes use of another hook that expects that input.\n\nThanks.",
