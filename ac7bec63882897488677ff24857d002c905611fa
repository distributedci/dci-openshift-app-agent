As discussed, I\u0027ve also included some Hints in order to test it in connected environments too, let\u0027s see how it goes, I\u0027ll retest tnf-test-cnf with this. I\u0027ll not test example-cnf because we have already checked that this change does not affect to its behavior.",

      "message": "The failure was because preflight_podman_auth variable was missed: https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/aed85fb1-f252-4fd6-88bf-d00befc13048/jobStates#e98e3199-57f4-4535-9aa6-1e0895ae2d68:file67. I could check that we are not giving a default value to that variable in preflight_check_container_podman and we need it because this variable is not defined in connected environments. I\u0027ve fixed it and, with this, libvirt job should pass. I\u0027ll not retest on dallas because there are no differences between the previous patchset and this in terms of functionality.",
