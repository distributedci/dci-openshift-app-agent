      "message": "Hello Ramón, \n\nI may be a bit late to this. I was thinking about why not having just a single file with credentials (dci_pull_secret + partner_creds if exists). Just to avoid having to have separate files for push, pull, etc. If the partner_creds is specific about the images, namespaces, or repos then specific credentials can be used for each image(s). So the same file can be used for pull/push according the needs.\n\nhttps://man.archlinux.org/man/community/containers-common/containers-auth.json.5.en",
