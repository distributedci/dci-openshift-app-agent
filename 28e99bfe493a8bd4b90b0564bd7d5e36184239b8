      "message": "Hello Ramón, \n\nI may be a bit late to this. I was thinking about why not having just a single file with credentials (dci_pull_secret + partner_creds if exists). Just to avoid having to have separate files for push, pull, etc. If the partner_creds is specific about the images, namespaces, or repos then specific credentials can be used for each image(s). So the same file can be used for pull/push according the needs.\n\nhttps://man.archlinux.org/man/community/containers-common/containers-auth.json.5.en",

      "message": "I\u0027ll do this tomorrow, we agreed on generating that new file.\n\nHowever, the question now is: should we have only one creds file and use it in all places? or should we create that file BUT maintaining partner_creds usage whenever is used? (e.g. preflight).\n\nI think we can use one single file for everything and that\u0027s all. It would not be a problem to have the content from DCI job pullsecret even though it is not used according to the reference provided by Beto. The only thing is that partner_creds \"would not be used\" as the source pullsecret file, but we will rely on the new file generated, but if you agree on this, let\u0027s do that.",
