      "message": "Hi Tony, Ramon, and Beto, thank you for all the reviews! I addressed the feedback, please do not hesitate to check once again.\n\nTony:\n\u003e Could you help me to understand better what role is playing operator-sdk in the certification? I\u0027m struggling to understand what the benefit operator-sdk is giving us on its own vs preflight.\n\nAs we discussed yesterday during the daily, that\u0027s for standalone testing, to ensure that they will not break the integration.\n\n\u003e Add a prefix to the role variables as we have been doing with other roles\n\nDone, thank you. I only kept credentials, kubeconfig and disconnected to be global, so that we have some visibility on them. Role-related variables are moved to use scorecard prefix.\n\n\nBeto:\n\u003e Should we add a README for this new role.\n\nDone, thanks.\n\n\u003e _ I think it will be good to document that {{ oc_tool_path }} and {{ opm_tool_path }} variables are required or set them to the default system binary. \n\nI\u0027ll push this change in 5 min, thanks, missed it somehow.\n\n\nRamon:\n\u003e Some comments from my side, mainly to confirm if some variables are still needed on preflight or not\n\nI refined the docs, thank you!",
