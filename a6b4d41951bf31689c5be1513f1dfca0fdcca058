      "message": "Hi all, let me explain the story behind this.\n\nRodrigo, from Solutions Team, while testing d-o-a-a for Ericsson CloudRAN, experienced two errors after checking with the latest d-o-a-a changes, including this CR from Beto: https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/dci-openshift-app-agent/+/24117:\n\n- He has failures because provision_cache_store was not defined, so we need a default value\n- In his case, in check_kubeconfig, `oc` executable was not already catched, so all the logic to copy the executables in provision_cache_store was triggered. But, when moving to the last task, \"Set client paths\", it was not executed (https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/446efacc-cf3d-4246-ac33-d71004f4741c/jobStates#3ac99d00-b892-4d85-9e8d-f76f2689872a:file29), and then he has a failure in this task: https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/446efacc-cf3d-4246-ac33-d71004f4741c/jobStates#081e6e9e-47ed-46a5-8eab-0fe46ccdf764:file11. In fact, we don\u0027t need conditions in \"Set client paths\", it can be safely executed without conditions because, in the end, the client paths will be there in all cases",
