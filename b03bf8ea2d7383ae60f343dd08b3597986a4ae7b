      "message": "Hi Tony and Pierre, thank you for the review, I trimmed the code following your ideas and applied everything except unarchive. It seems to require _archived_ files, so foo.tar.bz2 is ok but foo.bz2 is not, \"it\u0027s only compressed, technically, it\u0027s not archived\" :))  \n\nTests in Dallas are ok: https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/12ecb10a-aa0d-40a4-8c81-6a0e6ce68452/jobStates \n\nFile oval-report.html is a visual representation that could be checked in a browser and oval-report.xml is something that I\u0027d like to submit to Pyxis. The API for that does not exist yet but we\u0027ll discuss it. \n\nSide note: unfortunately, oval-report.xml is not in a JUnit format and we don\u0027t have a nice representation in DCI UI.",
