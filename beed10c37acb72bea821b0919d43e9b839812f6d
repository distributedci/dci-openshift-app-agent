I\u0027m going to merge this as a first iteration but I\u0027d like to discuss why would you like to avoid pre-run step, to better understand the motivation. In the current design, that\u0027s easy to move mirroring to the test step, and maybe we should do it.",

Currently, if you want to test multiple operators, you list them all in preflight_operators_to_check variable and then the flow goes like this:\n1/ In the disconnected environment, pre-run step generates one large index image that refers to all bundle images to be tested.\n2/ Test step tests the operators in a loop, one by one, with podman run command.\n\n\u003e I\u0027m thinking of a scenario where you would like to run the test multiple times (if that even makes sense 😄) I guess you could define OO_INDEX so you could test against that index. That\u0027s would be the workaround, right?\n\nIf you want to avoid pre-run step, then yes, you could run it once manually - mirror all images, generate index image, define OO_INDEX env variable.",
