If we list one, only one will be verified. \nIf we check the current example: there are eight test cases, three expectations were listed, only one failed, and the error is showing this failed one.\n\nWe already could merge this CR as a first step to prevent Preflight test suite regressions, like the one I discovered today. \n\nNext steps: to list each test by name is not a good idea, we have some test suites with thousand of tests. Probably, instead of the test case name, we could use regex, but I have no idea how to code that nicely.\n\n",
