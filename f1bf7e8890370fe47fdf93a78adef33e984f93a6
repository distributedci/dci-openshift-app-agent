      "message": "Hi Pierre, I created a job on cluster4 to recreate the failure and I was able to see what\u0027s happening. I think the problem is with `dci_gits_to_components` variable, whose default value is \"{{ dci_config_dir }}\". If you check the pipeline, dci_config_dir is a string, not a list, so when applying the operation in the when clause, it fails with the error shown in the jobs: \"Unexpected templating type error occurred on ...: must be str, not list\".\n\nI would say there are two options for fixing this: 1) transform `dci_gits_to_components` from string to list in the code, or 2) change `dci_config_dir` in pipelines to be a list",
