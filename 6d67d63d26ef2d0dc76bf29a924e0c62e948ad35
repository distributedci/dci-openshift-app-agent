Job runs fine and teardown cleans everything.\n\nNow, I\u0027m going to test the following:\n\n- run a job, again, with everything cleaned, but setting dci_teardown_on_* to false, to not delete the resources\n- run a second job, cleaning the resources from previous job in the pre-run, then continue as usual",
