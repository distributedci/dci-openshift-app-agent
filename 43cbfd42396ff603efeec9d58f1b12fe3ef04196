      "message": "I had multiple comments, so I decided to push the changes myself, hope you don\u0027t mind!\n\nI hope the changes are easy to understand, I\u0027ve simplified the merging of creds and the most important piece is the preservation of an order (more specific to less specific) when having a similar registry.\n\nIn the previous patchsets the expected creds were in place because quay.io from partner creds were used instead of the ones provided by the job. But if we had more specific registry paths like quay.io/telcoci, then it wouldn\u0027t work. This patchset takes care of that, having multiple ns/orgs end up in something like:\n\n- quay.io/telcoci/sub\n- quay.io/telcoci\n- quay.io",
