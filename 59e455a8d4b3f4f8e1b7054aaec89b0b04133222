      "message": "Yes, that\u0027s it. In the case of affiliated-certification-container-is-certified, it depends on the following field in tnf_config.yml file: `certifiedcontainerinfo`. If it\u0027s not filled (e.g. when tnf_certified_container_info is empty), then the affiliated-certification test is executed but skipped because there are no container images to check. I am enabling this here by default because, with this change, we are including the automation in tnf_config.yml.j2 to fill this info, but there are other affiliated-certification tests that are still not checked, that\u0027s why I\u0027ve just included that single test instead of the whole affiliated-certification suite. I hope I\u0027ve clarified your questios :)",
