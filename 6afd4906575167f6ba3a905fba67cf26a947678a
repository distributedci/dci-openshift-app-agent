      "message": "Yes, I agree, it looks like these components are taken from the cluster-wide operators that we deploy, e.g. PAO. Maybe a way of removing them is to add a kind of regex to each item from rtc_resources_to_components (default to \"*\"), to avoid this behavior. We can discuss about this separately, of course.\n\nAnd of course, all feedback is welcome, for sure all this comments will help to really target what we really want :)",

CSV will show any operator available in the ns, and there are some that are multi-ns or run in all ns, is best to reflect what\u0027s available in the ns rather than filtering.",
