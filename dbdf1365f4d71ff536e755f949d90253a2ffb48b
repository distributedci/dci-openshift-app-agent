      "message": "Hi Charles, I trimmed the formatting + retrieved annotations.yaml + fixed the error with the cert_project_id retrieval. The change is tested on certified-operators part.\n\nThe idea was to wait for Beto to be back from holidays to test the chart-verifier part. Since you\u0027re back from holidays, I let you deal with that, welcome back and thank you! \n\n",
